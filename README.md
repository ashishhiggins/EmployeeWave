The application for the Database Uses MongoDB. The MongoDB is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model.
The MongoDB cloud service is used to store the data. with required configuration could be found in the 
application.properties file.

As to run the application, most of the dependencies are already included in the pom.xml file.

I intended to host the application on cloud using AWS services, but unfortunately my AWS account access right now is
not free, and am unable to provide payment verification for other platforms as of now, I hope you could consider the
application as a local host application. Running locally on your machine should not be a problem, if the java runtime
is configured properly.

I hope This satisfies the requirements of the project. I am looking forward to your feedback and suggestions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
